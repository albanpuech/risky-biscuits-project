# Pints and Patterns: How Climate Shapes U.S. Beer Ratings

## Introduction

üçª Welcome to "Pints and Patterns: How Climate Shapes U.S. Beer Ratings"!

Get ready for a tasty and refreshing adventure! In this project, we are going to pop the cap off the worlds of beers and climate! 
Who hasn't dreamed of a cold beer on a warm summer's evening? Does a chilly breeze call for a stronger brew? These questions made us wonder: Perhaps our beer tastes change with the climate we're in!
We will take you on a bubbly journey to explore how the sunny beaches, snowy mountains, and everything in between across the U.S. influence the way Americans rate their favorite beers!

The questions we will be answering include:
- Is there a correlation between climate and the overall beer reviews?
- Does climate influence people's demand for taste, palate and aroma?
- How does beer ratings change across seasons in the different climate areas?

## Dataset
### Reviews
The dataset we will be using contains x reviews from two major beer ratings platforms, namely, Beer Advocate and Beer Review.
These reviews were posted by more than x unique American inhabitants, on a time period spanning the years x to x. The dataset is available at [1].

### Climate
We use the K√∂ppen climate classification data of the US states. The dataset was obtained from [2]. This climate classification is one of the most widely used ones.

It divides climates into five groups, which defines the first letter of the names of the climate classification groups. These are:
- A (tropical)
- B (arid)
- C (temperate)
- D (continental)
- E (polar)

All climates except for those in the E group are assigned a seasonal precipitation subgroup that defines the second letter, while the third one indicates the temperature subgroup. All in all, we obtain the following categories:

| K√∂ppen climate classification scheme | 1st | 2nd                 | 3rd              |
|--------------------------------------|-----|----------------------|------------------|
| **A (Tropical)**                     |     | f (Rainforest)       |                  |
|                                      |     | m (Monsoon)          |                  |
|                                      |     | w (Savanna, dry winter) |              |
|                                      |     | s (Savanna, dry summer) |              |
| **B (Dry)**                          |     | W (Arid Desert)      | h (Hot)          |
|                                      |     | S (Semi-Arid or steppe) | k (Cold)      |
| **C (Temperate)**                    |     | w (Dry winter)       | a (Hot summer)   |
|                                      |     | f (No dry season)    | b (Warm summer)  |
|                                      |     | s (Dry summer)       | c (Cold summer)  |
| **D (Continental)**                  |     | w (Dry winter)       | a (Hot summer)   |
|                                      |     | f (No dry season)    | b (Warm summer)  |
|                                      |     | s (Dry summer)       | c (Cold summer)  |
|                                      |     |                      | d (Very cold winter) |
| **E (Polar)**                        |     | T (Tundra)           |                  |
|                                      |     | F (Ice cap)          |                  |


## How does the average ratings of the US TOP 10 beers change across the climate regions?

Beer tastes surely are very subjective. Even among groups of close friends, starting a debate about beer tastes at dinner can be as risky as bringing up politics and religion at Thanksgiving! We have all heard of entire families getting destroyed and torn apart after children revealed their "beer orientation" to their parents.

Motivated by those stories, and aware of the power that was into our hands with our best data analysis tools, we realized the impact that we could have on resolving one of today's major challenge: avoiding Stanford graduates getting disavowed by their parents after they come back with their beer tastes totally changed by the warm climate of the Bay Area, that often pushes them to switch to lighter beers to go well with their weekly barbecues.

We first looked at the top 10 best rated beers in the US. [to be continued]
